Uses EntityFramework for the databases
Add a user manually to the database because you need to have Authentication headers with an existing user
via the SQLServer Object explorer
Only the Sign works properly
Use basic Authentication headers
Authorization: Basic <credentials>
Easier via Postman
You are able to add:
- Users
- Tasks
- Documents
A User has a List of Tasks and a List of Documents
